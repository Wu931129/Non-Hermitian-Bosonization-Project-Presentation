A Brief Review of Quantum Liouville Theory.pdf

1. An overview of Quantum Liouville Theory
Exploring its significance in 2D quantum gravity and non-rational conformal field theory.

2. Bosonization in 1D and Sine Gordon Model
A study on bosonization techniques in one dimension and their application to the Sine-Gordon model, discussing the duality between massive Thirring model and Sine-Gordon theory.
